## 📌 Overview

Hirely is a full-stack AI-powered recruitment platform designed to improve candidate-job matching using semantic analysis instead of traditional keyword-based filtering.

The system enables recruiters to identify high-quality candidates using AI-generated compatibility scores, automated assessments, and structured evaluation metrics.

## 🧠 AI Matching Logic

The AI engine:

4. Generates:
   - Match Score (0–100)
   - Compatibility explanation
   - Structured scoring breakdown

This improves candidate ranking accuracy compared to keyword-based systems.
